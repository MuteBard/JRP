                            <div className="pp1lvl4b4">My objective with Good Samaritan was to give the client more confidence in what he paid for when it comes to user-based features and trustworthy design</div>

                            <div className="pp1lvl4b6">I approached this app with the emotional state of losing something special in mind firstly. That idea created the trustworthy, happy, and reliable design from the color scheme to the user flow.</div>

                        <div className="pp1lvl3b11">The Competitive analysis showed that the market were mostly for pets. This definitely was a plus for Good Samaritan since this app organically offered more features. The target audience were students and adults between the age of 20-35 with the trending pain points of either quickly running out of time or geographical inconvenience.</div>

My source of strengths were from first-hand experience and my source of weaknesses were from first-hand experiences and app store reviews.</div>

Focusing the attention of the target audience, I conducted interviews around the local college and high school. From the trends of answers given I created Kaas and Shane; two outliers inside the target audience.</div>
